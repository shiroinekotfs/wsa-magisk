# Sideloading APKs in to Windows Subsystem for Android
-------------

## Setting up ADB to work with WSA
- Launch **Windows Subsystem for Android**.
- Here, enable **Developer mode** then tap on **Manage developer settings**.
- Use your left mousebutton to scroll down until you find **Wireless debugging**. Tap to open it and enable it.
- Tap on **Pair device with pairing code**. 
- Take note of **Wi-Fi pairing code**, and **IP address and port**.
- Launch Windows Terminal and make sure ADB is installed ([install ADB](https://www.xda-developers.com/install-adb-windows-macos-linux/#adbsetupwindows)).
- Use command ``adb pair <IP:port>`` to pair ADB with WSA.
- In Wireless debugging window, see **Device name** and under it **IP address and port**.
- Use command ``adb connect <IP:port>`` to connect WSA with ADB.

Once this is done, use command ``adb devices`` to make sure that WSA is connected.


## Installing APKs using ADB
Now you can install any app you want, but I personally suggest installing a web browser and a file manager first. 
Here's the [direct download link](https://github.com/bromite/bromite/releases/latest/download/x64_ChromePublic.apk) to the latest Bromite x64 build.
- Download the APK.
- Open File Explorer, right click on downloaded APK and tap on Copy as path.
- Launch Windows Terminal.
- Use ``adb install <file path>`` to install the APK.   
[**P.S.** You can right click to paste in Terminal]
- Repeat this process for a file manager app. I recommend using FX File Explorer, you can use what you want.

## After installation using ADB
You can now open the web browser you installed in Android, and download and install Aurora Store like you do on any Android device - normally sideloading APK without using ADB.
