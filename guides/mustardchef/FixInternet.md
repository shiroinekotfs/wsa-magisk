   <summary><h3>Fix #2: Checking Firewall Settings<h3></summary>
   
Sometimes Windows Firewall and other Firewall tools and software may be the cause of internet issues. It is therefore important that we check them if we are facing issues with internet on WSA.

   <summary><h4>Users with Windows Firewall<h4></summary>

****1. Open Windows Firewall by pressing the Windows Key and "R" key, Open Run****

   <summary><h4>Bitdefender Users (with Bitdefender's inbuilt firewall enabled)<h4></summary>

It is a known issue that Bitdefender's firewall can prevent the internet for Windows Subystem for Linux (WSL) and Windows Susbsystem for Android (WSA) from working.
There is currently no easy solution that I know of ( but there may be workarounds floating on the internet which involve whitelisting certain processes to fix these issues), for WSA and WSL, that can fix these issues other than the Bitdefender team fixing this at their end or the user having to turn off their firewall when using WSA or WSL.

   <summary><h3>Fix #4: Disabling Advanced Networking from WSA Settings<h3></summary>

1. Go to the Start Menu and search for Windows Subsystem for Android™
2. Depending on your WSA version, the Advanced Networking setting is located in different places witin the WSA Settings app

- For 2305 and newer builds, you must go to "Advanced settings" and then to "Experimental features"
- For 2304 and older builds, this setting is located in the "System" tab/ main screen when you open the Settings app

3. Make sure that if Advanced Networking is enabled, you disable it as this may be causing issues with the internet

This should fix the internet if Advanced Networking was on and the internet was not working due to this
