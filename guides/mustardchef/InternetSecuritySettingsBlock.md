## Issue: </br> Error stating that "Your Internet security settings prevented one or more files from opening" when trying to run `Install.ps1` or `Run.bat` to install Windows Subystem for Android (WSA)

### Preface:
##### This issue is caused if the folder name is too long. This is the typically the case as MagiskOnWSALocal script tends to generate a long string for the .zip file and the folder within the archive.

## Solution

The solution is simple, all you have to do is:

**1. Rename the .zip folder to a shorter name, which can be anything to your choosing </br> (For example: WSA_2XXX.XXXXX.X.X_XXXX_Release-Nightly-with-magisk-XXXXXXX-XXXXXX-MindTheGapps-XX.X-RemovedAmazon ----> WSAArchive2XXX)**

**2. Rename the extracted folder to a shorter name, which can be anything to your choosing </br> (For example: WSA_2XXX.XXXXX.X.X_XXXX_Release-Nightly-with-magisk-XXXXXXX-XXXXXX-MindTheGapps-XX.X-RemovedAmazon ----> WSAExtracted2XXX)**
