# Update WSA

> :warning:
>
> - Consider to end the process `VmmemWSA` by shuttting down the WSA in WSA control panel. If that doesn't help, restart your device.
> - Although you can run it as normal user, it is recommended to run all as `Administrator`

1. Clone the whole WSA repo
2. Run `Install.bat`
3. Once the updating is done, WSA will launch. You can press any key to exit, except by pressing the power button.
